var executeCmd = &cobra.Command{
	Use:   "execute",
	Short: "Execute a YouTrack command on an issue",
	Long: `Apply command strings to a story. A command string will modify one
or more attributes. Additionally, any trailing text will be added as a comment
to the story. For example:

goutrack execute yt-1234 "Assignee me" "I'll take this story."
goutrack exec yt-4321 "Subsystem server-side"
goutrack e yt-3214 "Accepted Add Reviewed by me"
goutrack c yt-4312 "Add scheduled for sprint-2" "Sliding to next sprint"
`,

		log.Printf("execute called as %+v", cmd)
	},
}

	// Here you will define your flags and configuration settings.

	// Cobra supports Persistent Flags which will work for this command
	// and all subcommands, e.g.:
	// executeCmd.PersistentFlags().String("foo", "", "A help for foo")

	// Cobra supports local flags which will only run when this command
	// is called directly, e.g.:
	// executeCmd.Flags().BoolP("toggle", "t", false, "Help message for toggle")
